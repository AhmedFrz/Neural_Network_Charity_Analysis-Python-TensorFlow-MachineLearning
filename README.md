# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning solution to help Alphabet Soup Foundation optimize their donation strategy by predicting which organizations will use funding effectively.

## Problem Statement
Nonprofit foundations face the challenge of allocating limited resources to organizations that will maximize social impact. Traditional application review processes are time-consuming and may not identify the most promising candidates consistently.

## Approach & Results

The solution employs a neural network classification model that achieved 73% accuracy in predicting funding success. Key components include:

- Multi-layer neural network architecture with optimized hyperparameters
- Comprehensive data preprocessing for 34,000+ organization records
- Model performance evaluation and iterative optimization

**Model Performance Comparison:**

| Model Version | Architecture | Accuracy | Loss |
|---------------|--------------|----------|------|
| Initial       | 2 hidden layers (80-30) | 73.0% | 0.556 |
| Optimized     | 3 hidden layers (80-60-30) | 73.0% | 0.562 |

## Business Impact

This data-driven approach provides significant advantages for donation strategy:

- **Enhanced Decision Making**: Replaces subjective assessment with consistent, data-backed predictions
- **Resource Optimization**: Focuses funding on organizations with higher probability of success
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces time spent reviewing applications unlikely to succeed
- **Improved Mission Effectiveness**: Maximizes social impact per dollar donated

## Technical Implementation

The model was developed using TensorFlow and includes:

- Sophisticated preprocessing pipeline for categorical feature encoding
- Standardized numerical features to optimize neural network performance
- Strategic hyperparameter tuning and architecture refinement
- Model checkpointing to preserve optimal weights during training

## Conclusion

This neural network solution transforms Alphabet Soup's donation process from intuition-based to evidence-based, enabling more effective resource allocation and greater charitable impact.
